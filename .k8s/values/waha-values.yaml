# WAHA Optimized Values - OTP Only Use Case
# Based on research: NOWEB engine for minimal resource usage
# Orange Wallet Production Environment

name: waha
namespace: orange-wallet
replicaCount: 1  # MUST be 1 for WhatsApp session

# Docker Image

  repository: devlikeapro/waha
  tag: latest

# Service Configuration
service:
  type: ClusterIP
  port: 3000

# Secrets (using existing waha-secret from secrets.yaml)

# WAHA Configuration - Optimized for OTP
config:
  timezone: "Asia/Jakarta"

  # CRITICAL: Use NOWEB for lightweight deployment
  # NOWEB uses @whiskeysockets/baileys (no Chromium)
  # Perfect for text-only OTP messages
  whatsappEngine: "NOWEB"

  # Minimal logging for performance
  logFormat: "PRETTY"  # PRETTY is lighter than JSON
  logLevel: "info"     # info is sufficient, avoid debug

  # Disable file management (OTP is text-only)
  filesLifetime: 0

  # Webhook - only essential events for OTP
  webhookUrl: "http://notification-worker:8080/api/webhooks/waha"
  # Minimal events: only message.ack for delivery status
  webhookEvents: "message.ack,session.status"

  # Session Management
  autoStartDelay: 3      # Faster startup for NOWEB
  restartAllSessions: true
  workerId: "waha-noweb-otp"
  printQR: true

# Persistent Storage - Minimized for OTP use case
persistence:
  # Sessions storage (authentication only)
  sessions:
    enabled: true
    size: 1Gi           # Reduced from 2Gi (sufficient for auth data)
    accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
    mountPath: /app/.sessions

  # Media storage - minimal (OTP doesn't need media)
  media:
    enabled: true
    size: 500Mi         # Reduced from 5Gi (just for temp files)
    accessMode: ReadWriteOnce
    mountPath: /app/.media

# Resource Limits - Optimized for NOWEB
# Based on research: NOWEB uses 128-256MB RAM
resources:
  requests:
    memory: "128Mi"     # Reduced from 256Mi
    cpu: "100m"         # Reduced from 200m
  limits:
    memory: "256Mi"     # Reduced from 512Mi (NOWEB is lightweight)
    cpu: "200m"         # Reduced from 500m

# Health Checks - Adjusted for NOWEB
healthcheck:
  liveness:
    initialDelaySeconds: 45   # Increased for Baileys initialization
    periodSeconds: 30
    timeoutSeconds: 10
    failureThreshold: 5       # More tolerant
  readiness:
    initialDelaySeconds: 40   # Increased - NOWEB needs time for Baileys
    periodSeconds: 10
    timeoutSeconds: 5
    failureThreshold: 5       # More tolerant

# Additional Environment Variables for Optimization
# These will be added to deployment template
additionalEnv:
  # Disable file handling (not needed for OTP)
  - name: WAHA_FILES_ENABLED
    value: "false"

  # Disable media download (OTP is text only)
  - name: WHATSAPP_DOWNLOAD_MEDIA
    value: "false"

  # Minimal retries for faster failure detection
  - name: WAHA_SEND_MESSAGE_MAX_RETRIES
    value: "2"

  # Disable unnecessary features
  - name: WAHA_SWAGGER_ENABLED
    value: "false"

  # Performance tuning
  - name: NODE_OPTIONS
    value: "--max-old-space-size=200"  # Limit Node.js heap to 200MB

  # CRITICAL: Disable API key for health endpoints (fix 401 on probes)
  - name: WAHA_HEALTH_MEDIA_FILES_THRESHOLD_MB
    value: "100"
  - name: WAHA_API_KEY_STRATEGY
    value: "WEBHOOK_AND_HEADER"

# Optimization Notes:
# ✅ NOWEB engine: ~50-70% resource reduction vs WEBJS
# ✅ Memory: 128-256MB (vs 512MB WEBJS)
# ✅ Storage: 1.5Gi total (vs 7Gi default)
# ✅ Faster startup: 20-30s (vs 40-60s WEBJS)
# ✅ Perfect for OTP-only use case
# ✅ No Chromium overhead
